# Incremental backup from remote
## Introduction
This is a script allowing to backup folder(s) of one or multiple servers from a client device.
The script uses `rsync` for the backup and connects using `ssh` with public/private identity keys.

I created this script because I needed a way to backup my NAS and my Raspberry to an external device located at my parents' in case something bad would happen  (fire, burglary, disk corruption, earthquake, nuclear attack, ...).

## Features
- Multiple source servers
- Multiple folders
- Exclude files/folders
- Incremental backup
- Sends email report (requires email account)
- Sends email alert on low space on backup drive
- Option for a dry run without actually copying files

## Installation
### Setup identity keys
On the machine doing the backup (local device), create the identity files
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your email>"
```
1. Choose path and name of the identity files (or just press enter: the files will be written as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
2. Choose password: leave blank (press enter)

Copy the content of the file `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public key).

On the remote device, login as a user having at least read access to the files/folders you want to backup. Paste the public key at the end of the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (create file if it doesn't exist).

To check if the connection works, login to local device and type the command below.
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <username on remote>@<ip or domain>
```
If the connection fails or if you are asked for a password, make sure that the following lines aren't commented in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on distant device:
```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys
```
If your changed the file, reload the daemon:
```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### Synology special case
If you still cannot connect or are prompted for a password, try the set the privileges on the following folders and files to 700 :
- /var/services/home/<username>
- /var/services/home/<username>/.ssh
- /var/services/home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
- /volume1/homes/<username>
```
USERNAME=<username>
cd /var/services/home
chmod 700 "${USERNAME}" "${USERNAME}/.ssh" "${USERNAME}/.ssh/authorized_keys" "/volume1/homes/${USERNAME}"
```
> On a synology NAS, by default, _root_ is not allowed running rsync over ssh so make sure you are using another user in _admin_ group. If you really need to run rsync as root (backing up /volume1/homes for instance), enable the admin account in DSM's control panel: Users > admin.


### Setup script on local device
1. Copy the script _ssh_rsync_backup.sh_ and _model.env.sh_ to optional folder on the device where you want the backups (or clone this repository to wanted location).
2. Set the file executable: `chmod +x ssh_rsync_backup.sh`.
3. Create a copy of _model.env.sh_ (e.g. _my-raspberry.env.sh_) and edit it to fit your needs; _model.env.sh_ is well commented, you wouldn't have any difficulties doing this.

> If you want to backup multiple devices, create multiple environmental files.

**Usage of the script:**
```
ssh_rsync_backup.sh [-v] [-d] -e <environment file>
-v: verbose
-d: dry-run
-e: the path to the environment file to use (required)
```

Try running the script:
```
/bin/bash <path to script> -v -d -e <my env file>
```
The script creates a log-file in the same folder as the script (`<environment_file_name>.log`).

### Schedule periodic backup
On the local device, edit the crontab:
```
sudo crontab -e
```
Add this line:
```
0 1 * * 3,6 /bin/bash <path to script> -ve <path to environment file> # Will run at 1 am twice a week (wednesday and saturday). Search the internet for crontab syntax.
```
Save and exit

> _crontab_ is running as root, make sure the path to the file is valid as the user `root` (i.e. use absolute paths).
